/**
 * Watch-mode renderer for snapshot commands (e.g. `fob-worker lines status --watch`).
 *
 * Renders in place on the main screen. Each tick sends:
 *   `\x1b[2J` — erase the visible display
 *   `\x1b[3J` — erase the scrollback / "saved lines" (xterm DECSED 3)
 *   `\x1b[H`  — home cursor to (1,1)
 *
 * The scrollback erase is the key bit: when a frame is taller than the
 * terminal viewport, the part that overflows scrolls into scrollback. Without
 * `\x1b[3J`, tops of past frames pile up across ticks. With it, scrollback is
 * purged each tick so only the current frame is ever visible.
 *
 * Side effect: any pre-existing scrollback above the command is also wiped
 * each tick. That's the trade-off for staying on the main screen instead of
 * using the alternate-screen buffer (which would hide the last frame on exit).
 *
 * If stdout isn't a TTY (e.g. piped to a file), falls back to plain append.
 *
 * `render` is invoked once per tick and may be async. Errors are not caught —
 * the loop is meant to halt on programmer mistakes, not silently spin.
